# Shadow-Defend-Game
- All source codes are written in Java and by me, except for the code skeleton [here](https://github.com/btlin1213/Shadow-Defend-Game/tree/master/bagel-zip-file) that constitutes the basis of any bagel-based development. 
- This game is developed as the project of SWEN20003 Object-Oriented Software Development Semester 1 (2020) at The University of Melbourne. 
- Project specs, the Bagel library, and everything in the `res` folders ([here](https://github.com/btlin1213/Shadow-Defend-Game/tree/master/res1) and [here](https://github.com/btlin1213/Shadow-Defend-Game/tree/master/res2)) are to be credited to the teaching team of this subject.


# Overview
Across Project 1 and 2, you will design and create a tower defense (TD) video game. Tower defense is type of strategy game where your goal as the player is (typically) to defend your territory from attackers. 

# Purpose
- Gain experience working with an object-oriented programming language (Java)
- Introduce simple game programming concepts (2D graphics, input, simple calculations)
- Gain experience working with a simple external library (Bagel)
  - Bagel Documentations can be found [here](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mcmurtrye/bagel-doc/)
 
# Content
- Part 1: Create the basis of a larger tower defense game that you will complete in Part 2B.
- Part 2A: Derive an UML diagram from Project 2 Specifications.
- Part 2B: Implement the UML diagram (the implementation may differ from the UML diagram in the process of implementation, but should be largely based on the UML diagram).
- Please read the specs for [part 1](https://github.com/btlin1213/Shadow-Defend-Game/blob/master/ShadowDefendSpecificationPart1.pdf) and [part 2](https://github.com/btlin1213/Shadow-Defend-Game/blob/master/ShadowDefendSpecificationPart2.pdf) for game details.
